create a python script with a GUI to select a city and show it from google maps

Absolutely, to create a Python script with a GUI for selecting a city and displaying it on Google Maps, you can use the tkinter library for the GUI and the webbrowser module to open the selected city on Google Maps in the default web browser. However, it's important to note that directly embedding Google Maps within a Python GUI may require an API key and a more complex setup involving a web browser control or a web-based GUI framework like PyQt with the Google Maps API.

Here's a simple example using tkinter that will open the selected city on the default web browser:

python
Copy code
import webbrowser
import tkinter as tk

def open_google_maps():
    city = city_entry.get()
    if city:
        url = f"https://www.google.com/maps/place/{city}"
        webbrowser.open_new_tab(url)

# Create the GUI window
root = tk.Tk()
root.title("City Viewer")

# Create and place widgets
label = tk.Label(root, text="Enter a city:")
label.pack()

city_entry = tk.Entry(root)
city_entry.pack()

show_button = tk.Button(root, text="Show on Google Maps", command=open_google_maps)
show_button.pack()

# Start the GUI loop
root.mainloop()
This script creates a simple window with an entry field for the city name and a button. When you enter a city name and click the "Show on Google Maps" button, it will open the city on Google Maps in your default web browser.

Remember, for a more sophisticated solution that embeds Google Maps directly into a Python GUI, you'd likely need to explore web-based frameworks or APIs, which might involve additional configurations and usage of Google Maps API.
